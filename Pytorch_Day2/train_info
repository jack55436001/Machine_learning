Calculate both train_dataset and val_dataset loss and acc
but only backward + optimize only if in training phase

two ways to perform transfer learning

Finetuning the convnet(more slow acc low but like another model)
Load a pretrained model and reset final fully connected layer
(still have backward + optimize like train other pretrain model)

ConvNet as fixed feature extractor(more fast acc high but just like reuse others pretrain model)

we need to freeze all the network except the final layer. We need
to set ``requires_grad == False`` to freeze the parameters so that the
gradients are not computed in backward(although it calls backprop in code)
